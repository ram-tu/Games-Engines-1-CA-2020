Assignment for Games Engines 1


For My assignment, I plan to make a procedural neon city. It will feature an infinite space, with buildings, hover cars, shooting starts, lights and if possible pedestrians. I will hopefully make this a first person view, where you are controlling the character in a car, and you will be able to drive around the city, viewing its lights and gorgeous sights. The world will be procedurally generated as the player moves along the world. 

My inspiration had come from a previous Games Engines assignment, and these various images

Here is a link to a previous year's assignment on a neon city
